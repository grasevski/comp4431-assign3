Assignment 3: Self Expression, Playtesting

Whip Ride
---------
Whip ride is a game of skill, courage and aggression. Players ride bikes in an arena, whipping each other into submission with makeshift whips.

### Rules

#### Aim

Whip your opponents into submission.

#### Assembly

This game requires the following items:

1. Makeshift whips (eg willow tree branches, bamboo, towels etc)
2. Bikes (eg BMX bikes, mountain bikes, tricycles etc)
3. Protective eyewear (eg goggles, sunglasses, etc)
4. Other protective wear is optional but highly recommended (eg jeans, hoodies, balaclavas etc)

#### Setup

1. Each player finds or makes a whip
2. Each player chooses a bike to ride
3. An arena is defined (ie a playing area with boundaries)
4. Each player chooses a starting point in the arena
5. Each player moves with their bike and their whip to their chosen starting position
6. Players must wear protective eyewear of some sort (eg goggles or sunglasses)

#### Play

1. Players ride about in the arena whipping each other.
2. Whipping must be kept to the shoulders down.
3. There is a time limit of 5 minutes, after which a draw is declared.
4. The winner claims their opponents whips. They can simply add these to their arsenal of whips for later battles, or they can restructure them or combine them with their other whips to make hybrid whips of some sort.

#### Scoring

A player loses under any of the following conditions:

1. They whip their opponent above shouder height
2. They leave the arena
3. They leave their bike
4. They give up

The last man standing wins, unless they agree on a draw due to some sort of stale mate.

There are several options for matching up players:

1. Laissez faire - flexible, suitable for small groups
2. Winner plays on - good for small groups
3. Elimination - good for short competitions
4. Round robin - good for long competitions
5. Ranking tables - good for large groups

#### Variations

This game varies greatly depending on the arena and equipment chosen, and there are virtually unlimited choices in this respect. Watch MacGyver for inspiration in designing and discovering your own whips and protective gear. Below are several commonly requested variations on the game:

* Use quad bikes instead of bicycles, because they are apparently more badass and easier to control
* Use tricycles, because they are easier to control
* Use a set of standardized whips, to reduce the element of luck in the game
* Some people opt for flat ground, to make the game more balanced
* Some people opt for wilderness, to add variation to the game
* A basketball court is an example of a simple, well sized and balanced arena which is well suited to bikes and provides clear boundaries

Making the game a team sport is another common suggestion.

#### Troubleshooting

Your chosen equipment has a great bearing on your success rate in battle:

1. Real whips are best avoided. There are less dangerous alternatives, for example fallen willow tree branches, thin bamboo branches, small vines, towels, rope, etc. Some alternatives such as computer and phone cables are also best avoided because they are quite heavy and can really leave a mark.
2. Wearing protective clothing is a good idea. Jeans, hoodies, balaclavas etc all provide good protection. Shorts and thongs are not for the faint of heart.
3. Choose a bike that is easy enough to ride sitting down with no hands if possible. It helps to be able to go hands free at times when whipping opponents.

### Equipment

Half of the game is obtaining the right equipment. BMX bikes and willow tree branches at the local park is one tried and tested combination. As previously noted, watching MacGyver comes in handy here.

Here are some examples for whips (remember, nothing too powerful):

* Willow tree branches
* Vines
* Thin bamboo
* Rope
* Towels

Here are some examples for vehicles:

* BMX Bikes
* Mountain bikes
* Tricycles
* Dirt bikes
* Quad bikes
* I suppose this game could also be played with scooters, skateboards, roller skates and so on

Here are some examples for arenas:

* Park
* Football field
* Basketball court


Design
------

### Goals

My overarching design goal was to create a game with simple rules and a dynamical system which encouraged lateral thinking, and expression and creativity over strategy and calculation.

#### Self expression

As per the assignment specification, I was aiming to create a game with rock-paper-scissors type dynamics. That is, rather than have the gameplay dictated by an obvious dominant strategy, I aimed for having a variety of strategies and tactics which were diverse, yet still balanced.

I also had to incorporate ongoing character development into the game. Ive never really been a fan of character development systems, as many seem to reward those with more game time, which seems to me like an unfortunate positive feedback loop (the rich get richer, grinding can become a dominant strategy), not to mention that seems to naturally occur already (experienced players can develop their own playing style and skills without additional aid). I have somewhat marginalized this design goal to some extent admittedly, however I have addressed it in a minimal way in an attempt to keep some of the core benefits whilst mitigating what I consider to be the counterproductive side effects.

#### Challenge

I aimed to make a challenging game which required a combination of skill and power, and my design mainly headed in the direction of physical and social skills. As stated earlier, I aimed to make a game which was instinctive and did not require too much abstract thought. Ie, my game focused more on lateral thinking and tactics than planning and strategy.

#### Fellowship

I aimed to make a competitive game with one on one conflict. Players would battle on many levels - physically (hand eye coordination), intellectually (lateral thinking, tactics), emotionally (insofar as overcoming taboo) and socially (psyche outs). I also aimed to incorporate a ranking system in order to make the game more concrete and not simply just a toy.

### Mechanics

The mechanics are listed above in the game rules, but I shall elaborate here. As per the spec, there are two main components to the mechanics:

1. The arena - two players battle each other
2. Ranking tables - there is an overall competition, players are matched based on a ranking system of some sort

The arena for this game is typically, but does not have to be, a small area of a park, with the boundaries marked out both implicitly (eg you would not want to ride into a pond) and explicitly (usually based on landmarks eg cant go past the telegraph pole, but witches hats can be used). Each player chooses or makes a whip (fallen willow tree branches are good for this, as real whips could be quite dangerous) and each player takes a (typically BMX) bike. They both choose a starting point in the arena. The battle then proceeds as specified in the rules.

Typically the minimal and primitive "winner plays on" system is employed for rankings, as there are usually only a small number of players playing, and each persons recovery time varies and can sometimes be quite long.

### Justification of mechanics

My game was designed from a toy-centric paradigm. I started by finding some toys which I liked - willow tree branches and bicycles. Playing with toys involves a lot of self expression, because there are few restrictions - it is up to the person playing with the toy what they want to do with it. By choosing these toys which I like, they were still engaging to play with without any objective other than to be entertained.

From playing with these toys for a few hours, a game naturally emerged. It was only a matter of minutes until one of my friends used a willow tree branch to whip somebody, and from this a competition naturally arised, due to the somewhat competitive nature of some of my friends. Eventually it was suggested that we whip each other whilst riding on bicycles, and the game was born. This is my justification for the somewhat vague description of the rules. Initially I simply told playtesters "you ride on bikes and whip each other", and as testing continued and a wider range of participants tested the game I refined the rules so as to streamline it and remove the boring parts of the game. Playtesting was difficult unfortunately, because the game tended to only appeal to a narrow audience of young, uninhibited and competitive males, and many potential playtesters declined for fear of being whipped.

This game facilitates self expression in the following ways:

1. Multiple styles of gameplay
2. Ongoing character development, both cosmetic and functional

The use of whips encourages specialization, because there are different types of whips, with natural tradeoffs. The length of the whip affects the range of the whip, as well as the "fire rate" (a shorter whip can be used quicker than a long whip). The number of strands affects how the whip can be effectively used. A one strand whip will be capable of making a devastating blow if used correctly, whereas a multi strand whip will be better for lashing. A beginner may be better off with a multi strand whip, where they can easily continuously lash (swing the whip across) their opponent, inflicting minor damage each time, whereas a more experienced player may vouch for a single strand whip, and try and make a single disarming contact on their opponent (by swinging the whip out to the player and quickly jerking it back to get the "crack" sonic boom sound). Other considerations include whether to have any leaves (or other light material) on the whip. Leaves can provide a good shield as they dampen opponents attacks, however they also dampen your attacks by causing drag. The player can then choose which leaves to keep, in a tradeoff between attack and defense.

The styles of gameplay are also naturally affected by players physiques, being a physical game. A large opponent may have more power, but they may also be less agile and also a greater target, so again there are trade offs and opportunities for specialization in this respect also.

Character development comes from physical development as well as the collection of whips. Each battle you win results in a new whip for you, which you can then customize to your own needs. As stated earlier in the goals however, I have somewhat minimized the positive feedback loops that often occur in ongoing character development, because I did not want them to detract from the game, especially for newcomers and casual players. The whips themselves will also naturally wear and tear over time, somewhat counteracting this positive feedback loop.

This game requires a few interesting skills, such as whipping, lashing, riding a bike, evading, and battle tactics. The playtesting seems to suggest that the winner typically has a few of the following traits:

* Strong whip
* Aggressive
* Focused
* Skilled whipping
* Good timing

Being a physically interactive game, this game has a strong social element to it. Players battle psychologically as well as physically, often taunting their opponents. With more players, a competition aspect would be more tangible, but for small numbers of players, simple systems such as winner plays on, round robin and elimination have been successful.


### Dynamics

Whip ride can vary in dynamics based on the players, but there are some general patterns:

* Players new to the game generally play defensively.
* If one player hits another, the other player is briefly disarmed. The aggressor usually then pummels the disarmed player until they give up. This is a positive feedback loop.
* A stronger whip will usually disintegrate a weaker whip if they continue to parry each other.
* Various playing styles emerge depending on the whips, the bikes and the arena.
* Large arenas result in sparse games, usually consisting of a series of jousts, whereas small arenas result in less riding and more whipping.
* Players will usually head for higher ground.
* Players with longer whips will try to maintain a distance from the opposing player, whereas players with shorter whips will generally try to evade the long whip and then rush in close to attack.
* Players generally give up after a few good whippings.
* Lashing is fast and requires little skill, but does less damage. A player will seldom give up after one lashing.
* Whipping on the other hand is slow and requires more skill, but has greater range and damage. One single well-timed whip can completely disarm an opponent.


Testing
-------

### Hypothesis

"Whip Ride" encourages multiple styles of gameplay, specialization, and ongoing character development, both cosmetic and functional. Winning in this game is a combination of skill and power. Players compete in one-on-one battles through ranking tables, and these battles are balanced.

### Aim

To test the hypothesis.

### Method

#### Sampling Methods, Recruitment, and Criteria

Playtesters recruited included mainly friends, fellow sports team members and willing university students. Originally the game was unofficially tested at a house party with both friends and acquaintances. This was quite successful, as everybody was quite adventurous and uninhibited. However subsequent playtesting proved difficult, as few people were willing to risk getting whipped.

#### Participants

A wide audience was attempted, but the only willing participants tended to come from a specific demographic:

* Young (teenager to young adult)
* Male
* Competitive
* Uninhibited

This was probably due to the somewhat violent and physical nature of the game.

The first official playtest consisted of two close friends. The second official playtest consisted of two fellow soccer team members. Each of these four participants fit the description above.

#### Playtesting and Observation Methods

Participants engaged in a playtesting session, in which they found whips and competed in several one-on-one battles, which were recorded on video. The game results (duration and winner) were later transcribed from the videos. Participants were also interviewed between games. Photographs were taken of some of the whips used.

#### Questionnaire

A 2-page feedback form was given to testers to fill out after the playtesting session. It asked players to provide short answers to the following questions:

1. What was your first impression?
2. How did that first impression change as you played?
3. Was there anything that you found frustrating?
4. Did the game drag at any point? (y/n)
5. Were there particular aspects that you found satisfying?
6. What was the most exciting moment of the game?
7. How was the game length? (too short, too long, just right)
8. Describe the objectives of the game.
9. Was the objective clear at all times? (y/n)
10. What was the most important decision you made?
11. What type of choices did you make during the game?
12. What was your strategy for winning?
13. Did you find any loopholes in the system? (y/n)
14. How would you describe the conflict?
15. In what way did you interact with other players?
16. What elements do you think could be improved?

### Results

#### Attitudinal

#### Behavioral

### Conclusion


Notes
-----
Substitute bicycles for tricycles and wilderness area for a basketball court or something. This would reduce the risk of injuries from falling off the bike, provide a more definite area of play, and allow for larger team games.
