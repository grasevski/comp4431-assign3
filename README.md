Assignment 3: Self Expression, Playtesting

Whip Ride
---------
Whip ride is a game of skill, courage and aggression. Players ride bikes in an arena, whipping each other into submission with makeshift whips.

### Rules

#### Aim

Whip your opponents into submission.

#### Assembly

This game requires the following items:

1. Makeshift whips (eg willow tree branches, bamboo, towels etc)
2. Bikes (eg BMX bikes, mountain bikes, tricycles etc)
3. Protective eyewear (eg goggles, sunglasses, etc)
4. Other protective wear is optional but highly recommended (eg jeans, hoodies, balaclavas etc)

#### Setup

1. Each player finds or makes a whip
2. Each player chooses a bike to ride
3. An arena is defined (ie a playing area with boundaries)
4. Each player chooses a starting point in the arena
5. Each player moves with their bike and their whip to their chosen starting position
6. Players must wear protective eyewear of some sort (eg goggles or sunglasses)

#### Play

1. Players ride about in the arena whipping each other.
2. Whipping must be kept to the shoulders down.
3. There is a time limit of 5 minutes, after which a draw is declared.
4. The winner claims their opponents whips. They can simply add these to their arsenal of whips for later battles, or they can restructure them or combine them with their other whips to make hybrid whips of some sort.

#### Scoring

A player loses under any of the following conditions:

1. They whip their opponent above shouder height
2. They leave the arena
3. They leave their bike
4. They give up

The last man standing wins, unless they agree on a draw due to some sort of stale mate.

There are several options for matching up players:

1. Laissez faire - flexible, suitable for small groups
2. Winner plays on - good for small groups
3. Elimination - good for short competitions
4. Round robin - good for long competitions
5. Ranking tables - good for large groups

#### Variations

This game varies greatly depending on the arena and equipment chosen, and there are virtually unlimited choices in this respect. Watch MacGyver for inspiration in designing and discovering your own whips and protective gear. Below are several commonly requested variations on the game:

* Use quad bikes instead of bicycles, because they are apparently more badass and easier to control
* Use tricycles, because they are easier to control
* Use a set of standardized whips, to reduce the element of luck in the game
* Some people opt for flat ground, to make the game more balanced
* Some people opt for wilderness, to add variation to the game
* A basketball court is an example of a simple, well sized and balanced arena which is well suited to bikes and provides clear boundaries

Making the game a team sport is another common suggestion.

#### Troubleshooting

Your chosen equipment has a great bearing on your success rate in battle:

1. Real whips are best avoided. There are less dangerous alternatives, for example fallen willow tree branches, thin bamboo branches, small vines, towels, rope, etc. Some alternatives such as computer and phone cables are also best avoided because they are quite heavy and can really leave a mark.
2. Wearing protective clothing is a good idea. Jeans, hoodies, balaclavas etc all provide good protection. Shorts and thongs are not for the faint of heart.
3. Choose a bike that is easy enough to ride sitting down with no hands if possible. It helps to be able to go hands free at times when whipping opponents.

### Equipment

Half of the game is obtaining the right equipment. BMX bikes and willow tree branches at the local park is one tried and tested combination. As previously noted, watching MacGyver comes in handy here.

Here are some examples for whips (remember, nothing too powerful):

* Willow tree branches
* Vines
* Thin bamboo
* Rope
* Towels

Here are some examples for vehicles:

* BMX Bikes
* Mountain bikes
* Tricycles
* Dirt bikes
* Quad bikes
* I suppose this game could also be played with scooters, skateboards, roller skates and so on

Here are some examples for arenas:

* Park
* Football field
* Basketball court

Notes
-----
Substitute bicycles for tricycles and wilderness area for a basketball court or something. This would reduce the risk of injuries from falling off the bike, provide a more definite area of play, and allow for larger team games.
